      Silverpeas 6 is on the way to be released in this year. It is yet in development so there is for now only one way to install it.
      For Silverpeas 5, our stable version of Silverpeas, there are different ways to install it according to your aims.

        <img src="../images/logos/tux.gif" alt="izpack" style="padding-right:10px;float:left;position:relative;"/>
        <br/>We are also providing GNU/Linux native packaging of Silverpeas 5. So if you want to give it a try go to
        <a href="http://www.silverpeas.org/repo/index.html">our Debian and RPM packages repositories</a>
      </p>
      <p>These packages are ready for both a try or a production use, but we don't guarantee the upgrade will work fine between major versions of Silverpeas.</p>
      <p>If you want to help us to provide a better packaging or propose new formats, feel free to look at the <a href="http://github.com/ehsavoie/silverpeas-native-packages">Github project</a> or to fund our efforts.</p>
