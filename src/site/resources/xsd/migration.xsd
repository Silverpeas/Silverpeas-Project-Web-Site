      This schema defines the grammar of a data source migration descriptor. Each descriptor
      defines for a given Silverpeas module a set of rules to migrate the data source schema to a
      newer state (newer version).
      A Silverpeas module can be either a Silverpeas Core Engine (or API) or a Silverpeas
      component.
      The descriptor is made up of two main elements:
        - current to specify the current version of the data source schema for the Silverpeas module,
        - upgrade to specify the version from which the rules has to be applied in order to pass to
        the next version.
      Each of these elements defines a list of scripts to run in order to migrate the data source
      schema from its current version up to the latest one. A migration can be then either a fresh
      installation of the schema or an upgrade of the existing one.

     The migration element is the root of the migration descriptor. It is defined for a given
     Silverpeas module and it declares the different migration rules to apply to either spawn
     the data source schema or to upgrade from all the previous versions of this schema.
     The name of the Silverpeas module is indicated by the attribute module.

      The migration root element is made up of the child elements below as ordered as
      following:
        - current to specify the current version of the data source schema for the Silverpeas module,
        - upgrade to specify the version from which the rules has to be applied in order to pass to
        the next version.
      The current sub-element is mandatory whereas the upgrade sub-element can be specified one or
      several times, each of them indicating an upgrade from a given data source schema version.
      The current element accepts as attribute the current version of the data source schema
      required by the Silverpeas module. The current element defines the rules set to apply for
      a fresh installation of the Silverpeas module. The upgrade element accepts as attribute the
      actual version of the data source schema for which it has to be taken into account in order
      to upgrade the schema to the next version. Each upgrade element defines a rules set to apply
      for upgrading the data source schema from the actual version to the next one. One or more
      upgrade can be then performed sequentially according to the actual version of the schema and
      the current version expected by the module.
